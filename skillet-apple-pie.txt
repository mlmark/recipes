Skillet Apple Pie
Adapted from “America’s Test Kitchen TV” (from the episode “Easy Apple Desserts”)
Serves: 6 to 8
Crust:
•	1 cup all-purpose flour (5 ounces), plus more for dusting
•	1 tablespoon sugar
•	1/2 teaspoon salt
•	2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, chilled
•	6 tablespoons, (3/4 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
•	3-4 tablespoons ice water
Filling:
•	1/2 cup apple cider
•	1/3 cup maple syrup
•	2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
•	2 teaspoons cornstarch
•	1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
•	2 tablespoons unsalted butter
•	2 pounds sweet apples and tart apples (about 5 medium), peeled cored, 1/2 halved, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges
•	1 egg white, lightly beaten
•	2 teaspoons sugar

1. For the Crust: Pulse flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined. Add shortening; process until mixture has texture of coarse sand, about ten 1-second pulses. Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture and process until crumbs are no larger than peas, about ten 1-second pulses. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons ice water over mixture. Pulse until dough comes together, adding up to 1 tablespoon more ice water if necessary. Turn dough out onto sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 4-inch disk. Wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes, or up to 2 days, before rolling out. (If dough is refrigerated longer than 1 hour, let stand at room temperature until malleable.)
2. For the Filling: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position (between 7 and 9 inches from heating element), and heat oven to 500 degrees F. Whisk cider, syrup, lemon juice, cornstarch, and cinnamon (if using) together in medium bowl until smooth. Heat butter in 12-inch heatproof skillet over medium-high heat. When foaming subsides, add apples and cook, stirring 2 or 3 times until apples begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat, add cider mixture, and gently stir until apples are well coated. Set aside to cool slightly.
3. To Assemble and Bake: Roll out dough on lightly floured work surface into 11-inch circle. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin, and unroll over apple filling. Brush dough with egg white and sprinkle with sugar. With sharp knife, gently cut dough into 6 pieces by making 1 vertical cut followed by 2 evenly spaced horizontal cuts (perpendicular to first cut). Bake until apples are tender and crust is a deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes; serve.
